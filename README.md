# Leaf Prediction using KNN

This project implements a **leaf prediction algorithm** using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm. The model is trained and tested on the **Iris dataset**, which is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community.

## Features

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, yet effective, classification algorithm.
- **Iris Dataset**: Utilizes the Iris dataset for training and testing the model.
- **Java Implementation**: The project is implemented in Java without using ML libraries.
